Hi! I'm Ha, and I'm a software engineer. For much of my career, I have focused on technologies to help build startups. I'm passionate about creating beautiful minimal apps and services that people love.

I believe that writing is an excellent way to help us to think, learn and understand. That's why in this blog, I try to explain technical problems and solutions with simple words and code.
